          Innovation Fair 2021 is returning with a theme of{" "}
          <strong>Post-Pandemic Era</strong>. We seeks to expand the boundary of
          personal well-being, enhance the experience of communal living, and
          initiate a dialogue between individual students and the community we
          live in.

              Self-isolation challenges our ability to keep mental and physical
              health by changing our daily routines and disrupting our internal
              and external balance. How can technical solutions help protect us
              from physical illness as well as re-balancing our internal
              well-being?

              Working and studying from home provided us with a unique
              experience that can be both difficult and revolutionary. How
              should technology be utilized to ensure personal organization and
              assert individualâ€™s sense of control against the irregularities
              posed by the pandemic?

              Our family, friends, and communities have firmly stood by our side
              during the pandemic. As our community is heading towards its
              post-pandemic normality, how can we help to ensure its smooth
              transition into the new reunion?
